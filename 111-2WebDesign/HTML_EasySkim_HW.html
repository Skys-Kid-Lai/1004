        <b>Abstract.</b> Recommendation systems are used to predict the interests of users through the analysis of historical preferences. Collaborative filteringbased approaches usually ignore the sequential information and sequential recommendation usually focus on the next item prediction. In this work, we would like to determine the next top-k recommendation problem. We propose User Preference Translation Model (UPTM) with item influence embedding and social relations between users. In addition, we will also solve the cold start problem in UPTM.<br>

        <h2>1 Introduction</h2>
&emsp;Recommendation systems are trying to learn the low dimensional representation
of users and items. Many features can be adopted in recommendation systems,
for example, user-item interactions, user features, item features, and other information such as the temporal factor.<br>
&emsp;Collaborative filtering-based approaches focus on learning users’ preference
and predict the items which users will have interest. The sequential relations in
users behavior are usually ignored in collaborative filtering. In our opinion, the
trigger relations between items are important for users behavior. For example,
people usually watch a series of related movies after they watch one of the
movie in this series. We would like to discover the target items which can trigger
users to buy as much related items as possible. Therefore, we adopt the social
influence propagation concept to model the trigger relations between items. In
social network, people spread influence to their neighbors and receive influence
from their neighbors at the same time. People usually be activated by their
friends, family, and followees. Same as the social network, assume an item-item
network is formed from users’ sequential interaction behavior with item. The
propagation of item influence can be used to indicate the likelihood of a user
interacting with a related item based on their interaction with the target item.<br>
<br>
&emsp;In sequential recommendation research, we consider the sequential information in users behavior. Given the users’ interaction behavior, the problem can be
defined as predicting the next item which user will interact. However, we would
like to recommend the next k items which users will interact in the future. First,
we address the recommendation problem as the next top-k recommendation
problem. We propose a User Preference Translation Model with item influence
embedding, abbrev. as UPTM, to solve this problem. In the future, we would
like to join the social relations between user and propose the social recommendation with UPTM. In addition, the cold start problem is usually ignored in the
sequential recommendation systems. We will propose a new scheme to deal with
the cold start problem in UPTM.

        <h2>2 Related Works</h2>
          <h3>2.1 Collaborative Filtering with Deep Neural Network</h3>
Collaborative filtering solves the recommendation problem by assuming that
users with similar behaviors exhibit similar preferences for items. He et al. [2]
propose NeuMF to combine the multi-layer perceptron and matrix factorization
to learn the user and item embedding. Wang et al. [4] propose NGCF which is
based on the graph neural network. They encodes the collaborative signal which
represents the high-order connectivities by performing embedding propagation.
Another kind of Generative Adversarial Networks-based methods try to apply
GAN to recommendation. Chae et al. [1] suggest a new direction of vector-wise
adversarial training and propose the GAN-based CF framework.<br>
          <h3>2.2 Social Recommendation Systems</h3>
On social network, people spread influence to their neighbors and receive influence from their neighbors at the same time. A user is activated by another
user since they have same opinion tendency. Social recommendation systems
that examine the propagation of influence among network members end up with
users who share similar interests connected along diffusion paths. Wu et al. [5]
propose DiffNet to model the recursive social influence propagation process and
learn the user and item representation in social recommendation. Zhu et al. [6]
propose Social Collaborative Mutual Learning Model to combine the item-based
collaborative filtering and social collaborative filtering.
