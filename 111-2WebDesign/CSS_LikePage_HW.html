			Abstract. Recommendation systems are used to predict the interests of users through the analysis of historical preferences. Collaborative filtering-based approaches usually ignore the sequential information and sequential recommendation usually focus on the next item prediction. In thiswork, we would like to determine the next top-k recommendation problem. We propose User Preference Translation Model (UPTM) with item in influence embedding and social relations between users. In addition, we will also solve the cold start problem in UPTM.​

			In  sequential  recommendation  research,  we  consider  the sequential  information  in  users  behavior.  Given  the  users’ interaction behavior, the problem can be defined as predicting the  next  item  which  user  will  interact.  However,  we  would like to recommend the next k items which users will interact in  the  future.  First,  we  address  the  recommendation  problem as the next top-k recommendation problem. We propose a User Preference Translation Model with item influence embedding, abbrev.  as  UPTM,  to  solve  this  problem.  In  the  future,  we would  like  to  join  the  social  relations  between  user  and propose the social recommendation with UPTM. In addition, the  cold  start  problem  is  usually  ignored  in  the  sequential recommendation  systems.  We  will  propose  a  new  scheme  to deal with the cold start problem in UPTM.​

			I.  INTRODUCTION
		</div>
		<div class="back sma">
			Recommendation systems are trying to learn the low dimen- sional representation of users and items. Many features can be adopted  in  recommendation  systems,  for  example,  user-item interactions, user features, item features, and other information such as the temporal factor.
		</div>
		<div class="back sma">
			Collaborative  filtering-based  approaches  focus  on  learning users’ preference and predict the items which users will have interest. The sequential relations in users behavior are usually ignored  in  collaborative  filtering.  In  our  opinion,  the  trigger relations between items are important for users behavior. For example, people usually watch a series of related movies after they  watch  one  of  the  movie  in  this  series.  We  would  like to discover the target items which can trigger users to buy as much related items as possible. Therefore, we adopt the social influence  propagation  concept  to  model  the  trigger  relations between  items.  In  social  network,  people  spread  influence  to their  neighbors  and  receive  influence  from  their  neighbors  at the  same  time.  People  usually  be  activated  by  their  friends, family, and followees. Same as the social network, assume an item-item network is formed from users’ sequential interaction behavior with item. The propagation of item influence can be used  to  indicate  the  likelihood  of  a  user  interacting  with  a  related item based on their interaction with the target item.

				A. Collaborative Filtering with Deep Neural Network
			</div>
			<div class="back coner" style="top: 48px;">
			Collaborative filtering solves the recommendation problem by assuming that users with similar behaviors exhibit similar preferences for items. He et al. [2] propose NeuMF to combine the  multi-layer  perceptron  and  matrix  factorization  to  learn the user and item embedding. Wang et al. [4] propose NGCF which  is  based  on  the  graph  neural  network.  They  encodes the  collaborative  signal  which  represents  the  high-order  con- nectivities  by  performing  embedding  propagation.  Another kind  of  Generative  Adversarial  Networks-based  methods  try to  apply  GAN  to  recommendation.  Chae  et  al.  [1]  suggest  a new direction of vector-wise adversarial training and propose the GAN-based CF framework.

			<div class="back coner " style = "top: 280px;">
			On  social  network,  people  spread  influence  to  their  neigh- bors  and  receive  influence  from  their  neighbors  at  the  same time.  A  user  is  activated  by  another  user  since  they  have same  opinion  tendency.  Social  recommendation  systems  that examine the propagation of influence among network members end up with users who share similar interests connected along diffusion  paths.  Wu  et  al.  [5]  propose  DiffNet  to  model  the recursive  social  influence  propagation  process  and  learn  the  user and item representation in social recommendation. Zhu et

			In the current study, recommendations are generated by using previous behavior patterns to predict the items that are likely to interest the user in the future. In the following,<math><mi><i>U</i></mi><mi>={</mi><mi><i>u</mi><sub>1</sub>, <mi>u</mi><sub>2</sub>, ...<mi>u<sub>m</sub></i></mi>}</mi></math> denotes the user set and <math><mi><i>I</i></mi><mi>={</mi><mi><i>i</mi><sub>1</sub>, <mi>i<sub>2</sub></mi>, ..., <mi>i<sub>n</sub></i></mi><mi>} </mi></math> denotes the item set.

			B.  User Preference Translation Model
		</div>
		<div class="back sma">
			The  proposed  translation-based  recommendation  model  is illustrated  in  Fig.  1.  The  model  includes  a  simulation  of item  embedding  and  a  translation  of  user  preferences.  The proposed  scheme  is  based  on  the  assumption  that  users  are likely  to  interact  with  items  that  are  associated  with  other items  that  they  already  possess.  We  propose  using  influence diffusion  to  learn  the  relationships  among  items.  We  first generate  item  influence  diffusion  paths  from  social  influence  paths sampled from the item-item relation graph from which

UPTM then learns the parameters in the  hidden  layer  to  output  the  item  embedding  and  generate a  recommendation  list  from  the  decoder  of  the  translation module,  to  which  is  applied  a  softmax  function  and  top-k sampling.

		<div class="back rightAway" style="margin-top:-230px;">
			We  would  like  to  apply  UPTM  on  social  recommendation by  adding  the  users’  social  relation  in  the  item  embeddings. Each user are encoded into a user embedding to represent the user’s social relations in the social network. Then, we add the user embedding into the items to translate the user preference.

			For  evaluating  the  performance  of  proposed  model,  we compare UPTM model with other existing model on real sev- eral datasets such as Movielen, Amazon, and Yahoo datasets. We  use  the  precision,  recall  and  NDCG  metrics  to  evaluate the  performance  for  UPTM.  In  table  I,  we  only  show  the results of NDCG. For overall performance comparison, UPTM outperforms  other  comparing  methods  on  three  metrics  for the  next  k  item  recommendation  problem.

However, most sequential recommendation cannot deal the cold  start  problem  since  the  new  items  are  not  shown  in the  training  process.  The  sequential  recommendation  usually ignore  this  problem.  In  previous  recommendation  systems, they  usually  use  the  popularity  of  items  or  the  similarity  of users’ preference to recommend. We would like use the users’ social  relation  and  give  the  initial  item  embedding  for  cold start  items.  We  will  join  this  idea  to  solve  the  cold  start problem in UPTM.
